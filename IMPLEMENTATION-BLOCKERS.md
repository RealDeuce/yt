# Implementation blockers and documentation gaps

This ledger records facts required by the C17 implementation that are not
fully specified by the completed Yankee Trader 3.6G analysis. Do not close a
gap by disassembling binaries or performing new reverse engineering in this
repository. Implementation stops at the affected boundary until the upstream
documentation supplies the missing contract.

## Open documentation gaps

### DOC-GAP-003: unshielded sector-mine missile RNG in joined fatal contracts

Affected coverage:

- anonymous sector-mine body and its caller continuations;
- direct fighter-kill raw FIELD/store/news/RNG composition; and
- direct fighter destroyed-to-fatal raw transaction.

The upstream contracts disagree about the positive-missile branch of an
unshielded sector-mine batch:

- `docs/runtime/sector-mine-output.md` specifies one direct missile `RND`,
  identifies site `YT-SUB:679B`, and agrees with
  `tools/ytmine_output.py`, which consumes
  `batch<N>.missiles` once and applies
  `INT(RND * (batch * missiles)) + 1`.
- `docs/runtime/direct-fighter-fatal-cycle-output.md` instead lists
  `missile TIMER/RANDOMIZE/RND x3` in its joined RNG order.

The retained direct-fighter fatal fixture has zero missiles, so its generated
artifact, 13-draw trace, and 1,597/1,900-byte transcripts do not exercise or
resolve the disagreement. The native `mine_encounter()` currently follows
the sector-mine component contract and executable model by consuming one
direct draw. Do not promote a joined raw transaction that admits positive
missiles until the upstream fatal-cycle prose is corrected or the intended
caller-specific difference is documented and pinned by an exercised fixture.

## Resolved documentation gaps

### DOC-GAP-001: sequential character-device `PRINT` adapter

Affected coverage:

- BRUN regular-file `PRINT`/`CLOSE` and shared CLOSE-all registry
- BRUN regular-file sequential `OUTPUT OPEN`

Resolved upstream by commit `c08f1fca` in
`docs/runtime/brun-print-transducer.md`. The contract now specifies:

- one ordered one-byte physical write per logical byte, with the final pending
  byte offered by statement completion;
- accepted and dropped clear-carry results, including the compatibility-bit
  distinction;
- exact pending/index/column residue at value-write and completion failures;
- the absence of a synthetic carrier-loss edge; and
- the device-code newline distinctions used by rooted callers.

The shared projection is implemented by `yt_text_device_print()` with focused
per-write provider tests. Raw allocator/registration cleanup remains a mapped
implementation obligation, not a documentation gap.

### DOC-GAP-002: `YTMAINT` radio-compaction file transaction

Affected coverage:

- YTMAINT message compaction and newspaper rotation
- `YTRMSG.DAT` radio store/compaction

Resolved upstream by commit `c08f1fca` in
`docs/file-formats/YTRMSG.md`. The contract now specifies:

- the preliminary OUTPUT/CLOSE/KILL sequence that removes an old `temp`;
- a fresh RANDOM destination with the 4/4/4/72 FIELD layout;
- explicit source `GET` and dense destination `PUT` record numbers; and
- source `#5`, then destination `#4`, then KILL, then NAME ordering.

The documented transaction is implemented by `yt_radio_compact()`.

## Explicitly deferred work

These are authorized deferrals rather than missing-analysis gaps:

- exact `LOCAL.EXE` console/menu/DORINFO/SHELL/local-framebuffer
  compatibility; and
- platform-specific OpenDoors startup, exit, and post-OPEN wait behavior.
